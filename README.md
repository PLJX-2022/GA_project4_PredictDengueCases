## Introduction

[Dengue fever](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/192/topic_dengue_fever_MOH) is spread though the bite of the Aedes mosquito. To prevent dengue fever, one must prevent the breeding of the Aedes mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes are identified by the black and white stripes on their bodies. It prefers to breed in clean, stagnant water easily found in our homes. You can get rid of the Aedes mosquito by frequently checking and removing stagnant water in your premises. The NEA has a stringent B-L-O-C-K **STOP Dengue Now** campaign.

## Problem Statement

In view of the NEA's KPI and annual budget given

- We aim to provide data insights and forecast the next dengue cluster region out of the five: West, North, North-East, East and Central, and guide NEA in allocating operational resources.

## Datasets

**EDA**

- Key takeaway from EDA: The dengue cluster spread is entirely different for different regions. It is not possible for us to speculate the next dengue cluster and machine learning models will help us!

**Modeling**

We test and error different models for separate sets of regional data and came up with the Ensemble Models based on the best performing models:

## Conclusion

For year 2019, NEA should allocate more resources on the East region of Singapore based on our prediction that East areas will have the highest number of dengue cluster cases.
